# WLDE---Csharp-Project

Online Shop example build with CSharp. One of the first large projects I made while attending university. I harnessed Visual Studio 2015 and .Net technology to deploy some basics
functions such as Register a user, delete a user, add to the shopping cart, delete the selection from the cart or generate a basic invoice to specify the bought items; their quantity, 
total price, and a summary of the purchase.
